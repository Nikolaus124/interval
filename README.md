# README

This is a simple web-site where you can keep a database of records for doctors. JQuery pickers are used here to simplify information entry.

To run the application you need:

* Ruby version: 2.7.2

* Rails version: 6.0.3.4

* MySQL2

* Clone this repository to empty folder

* Enter this folder in console and run: bundle install

* In file ../config/database.yml set username and password

* Run rails db:create to create database.

* Run rails db:migrate to run migrates in this project.

* And run rails s to start project server.


For the project to work correctly, you need to create at least one doctor using MySQL, as this item is not provided in the project.
